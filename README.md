# PMT Analysis repository #
pmt_analysis provides the basic tools used for the study of the response of the PMTs of the ICARUS experiment and their calibration. This project is currently under develelopment.

## Getting Started ##
### Get the source ###
Clone the reposotory on your personal space using `git` or fork the project to your personal GitHub page. 
### External software dependencies ###
The core of the projects depends on: 
* ROOT 6.15 or higher: https://root.cern.ch/downloading-root  
* Eigen: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
* CMake: https://cmake.org/
Some task-specific scripts may requires some common python packages such as numpy, pandas, and uproot. 

On an experiment dedicated GPVM machine at FNAL, all required packages are found on CVMFS and configurable as ups products thanks to  `./configure.sh`. Alternatively, the user should edit the `configure.sh` scripts pointing to their local installation of the required packages. 
### Set up your personal space ### 
On a GPVM machine at FNAL, the environment is configured simply sourcing `configure.sh`. This must be done any time at relogin. On a personal machine, the user can set his own enviroment by editing `configure.sh` in the most appropriate fashon and sorucing it.

## Project structure ## 
### Class `Run` ### 
Handles the single file metadata. For example it provides the association between the run-subrun number and the active optical channel during that particular run. 
### Class `Waveform` ### 
Process data at the single Waveform level. Noise filtering, signal idenfification logics, and pulse fitting should be included here.
### Class `PMT` ### 
Aggregate information from many events and many files at PMT level. Noise filtering, signal idenfication logics, and pulse fitting should be included here.
### Other libraries ### 
Other classes and function are provided to simplify tasks and define helper functions

## Use macros ## 
During the data exploratory phase or for quick analysis tasks which doesn't involve using many files at each times, it is possible to use ROOT macros linked to the main project libraries. To do so:
``` bash
cd macros/
root -l loadLib.cc my_macro.cc
```
The script `loadLib.cc` must always be called before a root macro including any of the project libraries. Its job is to create a ROOT dictionary for the project custom libraries. 

Examples macros are provided to show to the user how to structure a simple analysis project or quick data visualization. 

## Compile pmt_analysis ## 
For the processing of large pmt datasets  it is necessary to compile pmt_analysis. This part of the project is not yet ultimated, however a small example is provided in `waveform/` . More detailed instruction will come in a near future. 

To compile it is necessary to have CMake installed. Then in the main project directoy do: 
``` bash
mkdir builddir/
cd builddir
cmake ../
cmake --build .
cd ../
```
If every step is successful it will be possible to test the waveform analysis: 
``` bash
waveform -i path/to/input-file.root -o /path/to/output-file.root
```

## Future additions ## 
There are many areas of improvements for this project. One of the most important is providing examples of production scripts that can be used to process the PMT calibration dataset. These scripts will work exclusively on the computing nodes at FNAL. More instruction will follow soon.
